Feature	Fusion++	Unreal Blueprints	Unity C# Scripting
Execution Model	AOT + JIT hybrid: FPP → C++ → LLVM → native binary + runtime patching	Interpreted VM; event graph compiled to bytecode	Mono/.NET runtime; managed execution
Performance	Native speed with inline NASM, SIMD, manual memory	Slower due to abstraction overhead	Faster than Blueprints, but below native
Scripting Paradigm	Instructional + derivational DSL with inline assembly	Visual event graph, node-based scripting	C# imperative scripting with strong OO
Customization Depth	Low-level control: emit, patch, memory structs, compiler reflection	Limited to Blueprint nodes and native C++	Good extensibility, but managed limitations
Multiplayer + AI	Multi-threaded socket server, AI traits, self-learning routines	Blueprint logic with replication support	Requires manual threading/sync
Hot Reload	Real-time .fpp update + inline bytecode patching	Partial, often needs recompile	Hot reload supported but unreliable
Tooling	Mobile companion app, self-training GPT loop, weekly model retrain	Visual Editor, Material Designer, Sequencer	Unity Editor, Visual Scripting Add-on
Graphics Integration	OpenGL-native 2D/3D pipeline, terrain & skeletal tools	DirectX/OpenGL/Vulkan via Unreal Engine	DirectX/OpenGL support via Unity Engine
Learning Curve	Steep, requires logic/assembly mindset	Very beginner-friendly	Moderate for devs with C# background
AI-Augmented Dev Loop	Repaired script logging → GPT fine-tuning → live prompt injection	None built-in	None built-in
