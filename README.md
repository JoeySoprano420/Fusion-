# Fusion-
A high-performance, instruction-oriented, derivative-wrapped AAA game development language.

🔥 PHILOSOPHY
FUSION++ blends:

✅ C++ Grammar for native familiarity

✅ NASM-style Structural Execution

✅ Dynamic Predefined Rules (e.g. movement, asset streaming, AI)

✅ Serialized Natural-English C++ Logic (Readable, Writable, Explicit)

✅ Derivation-Based Type Logic (types are derived from behavior)

✅ Induction Semantics (contextual rule propagation and folding)

⚙️ COMPILATION MODEL
FUSION++ source code (.fpp)

🔽 AOT Compilation → fpp2c: emits .cpp file

🔽 JIT Compilation → c2exe: builds .exe using embedded Clang/GCC

🔽 Runtime patcher injects inline ASM segments and texture/audio memory maps
