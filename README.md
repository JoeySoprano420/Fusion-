# Fusion-
A high-performance, instruction-oriented, derivative-wrapped AAA game development language.

🔥 PHILOSOPHY
FUSION++ blends:

✅ C++ Grammar for native familiarity

✅ NASM-style Structural Execution

✅ Dynamic Predefined Rules (e.g. movement, asset streaming, AI)

✅ Serialized Natural-English C++ Logic (Readable, Writable, Explicit)

✅ Derivation-Based Type Logic (types are derived from behavior)

✅ Induction Semantics (contextual rule propagation and folding)

⚙️ COMPILATION MODEL
FUSION++ source code (.fpp)

🔽 AOT Compilation → fpp2c: emits .cpp file

🔽 JIT Compilation → c2exe: builds .exe using embedded Clang/GCC

🔽 Runtime patcher injects inline ASM segments and texture/audio memory maps

TYPE SYSTEM
| Type Alias  | Base Type   | Behavior                  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `entity`    | struct      | Position, draw, animate   |
| `state<T>`  | variant     | Stores logical state flow |
| `derive`    | template    | Functional trait mapping  |
| `memory<N>` | byte buffer | Manual memory control     |


🚀 KEYWORD SET
| Keyword          | Purpose                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `define`         | Entity/type/variable definition |
| `derive`         | Type extension                  |
| `instruction`    | Function-like execution unit    |
| `tagged`         | Logical grouping                |
| `init`, `let`    | Variable declarations           |
| `on`, `trigger`  | Event bindings                  |
| `load`, `stream` | Asset and audio control         |
| `asm`            | Inline low-level execution      |
| `wrap`           | Derivative override             |
| `emit`           | Force-output compiled logic     |
| `patch`          | Inject runtime behavior         |
