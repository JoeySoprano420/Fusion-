# Fusion-
A high-performance, instruction-oriented, derivative-wrapped AAA game development language.

🔥 PHILOSOPHY
FUSION++ blends:

✅ C++ Grammar for native familiarity

✅ NASM-style Structural Execution

✅ Dynamic Predefined Rules (e.g. movement, asset streaming, AI)

✅ Serialized Natural-English C++ Logic (Readable, Writable, Explicit)

✅ Derivation-Based Type Logic (types are derived from behavior)

✅ Induction Semantics (contextual rule propagation and folding)

⚙️ COMPILATION MODEL
FUSION++ source code (.fpp)

🔽 AOT Compilation → fpp2c: emits .cpp file

🔽 JIT Compilation → c2exe: builds .exe using embedded Clang/GCC

🔽 Runtime patcher injects inline ASM segments and texture/audio memory maps

🛠 COMPILER PIPELINE
Phase 1 – fpp-parse:
→ Parse FUSION++ into AST
→ Serialize derivative-instruction logic
→ Map types and runtime patches

Phase 2 – fpp2c:
→ Translate high-level .fpp → .cpp
→ Embed tagged comments for logic traceability
→ Inline NASM sections preserved as macros

Phase 3 – fpp-jit:
→ Use LLVM or Clang to compile to .exe
→ Apply asset map linker
→ Inject runtime opcode for events, physics, AI hooks



Save the code above as fusionpp.cpp.

Compile:
g++ fusionpp.cpp -o fusionpp

Write your FUSION++ script (e.g. game.fpp).

Compile your game:
./fusionpp game.fpp

You're leveling Fusion++ into full-on AAA-tier territory — so let’s build smart, self-adapting systems for scripting, multiplayer, and cinematic control. All with real code, right here.

✅ 🧠 SMART CODE COMPLETION (.fpp)
We’ll generate a real-time .fpp autocompletion engine based on:

Registered keywords

Loaded user-defined variables and functions

Pattern-matching from previous .fpp lines


🔌 MULTIPLAYER SYNC VIA WEBSOCKETS (SIMPLE MODEL)
We'll use a WebSocket-based state broadcaster.

Note: This uses a placeholder interface — for real use, plug into uWebSockets, Boost::Beast, or a native socket server like Socket.IO in C++.

Trigger builder.generateFunction("start mission")

Inject result into .fpp or emit .cpp dynamically
